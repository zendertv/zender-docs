# Studio Setup advice
The following is a typical studio setup:
- 1 director : who triggers the questions, etc..
- 1 presentor: who reads the questions , chats etc..
- 1 moderator: prepares feedback from the audience,  moderates the chat [optional]

Screens & Computer:
- The director has a screen and computer with the admin open (using chrome browser)
- The presentor has a separate computer with a large display to read the questions from a screen (like a teleprompter)
- Typically the director and presentor face eachother for visual clues if needed
- Be sure to sync the clocks using something like NTP
- Disable screensavers, power saving etc..

Camera Video/Audio/Streaming:
- Either a hardware video encoder/or a dedicated computer are to be used for the streaming in the studio
- The camera can be both portrait or rotate landscape
- The presentor has a green-screen , a wireless microphone and a visual of how he is centered on the screen

Media:
- A short image/video for in between shows that is shown in the lobby
- A short image/video to be uploaded in the admin to indicate any problems to the users
- A short countdown video when the show is about to start with hints (check wifi, check battery, ...)

Network:
- Enough bandwith for upstreaming the video (min 1.5 Mbps)
- Avoid shared bandwidth , use a dedicated wifi/cabled network
